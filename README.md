# TeaAppIOS

I decided to create an app to provide some insight into different types of tea such as: what each type of tea is, how they are made, how to brew a perfect cup, as well as some fun facts regarding each type. I designed my app to have three main pages: a Home Page, a Learn More Page, and finally a Quiz Page. This allows the user to see an overview of what the application is for and then decide if they want to learn about different types of teas or if they want to take a quiz to determine what kind of tea would be best for them. For my final project, the main API feature I used was the Tab Bar Controller, however I also used a Navigation Controller, Stack Views, Control Views, Table Views, Image Views, Scroll Views, Animations, and Gestures.
